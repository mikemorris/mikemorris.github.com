Led an initiative to redesign, document and scale an Elixir API powering a food ordering app and website. Prototyped and tested a Kubernetes cluster environment on AWS, ultimately determing that minor rearchitecture work could enable horizontal scaling while maintaining a simpler infrastructure on Heroku. Taught DevOps concepts to a growing engineering team, guided software architecture evolution and built CI/CD pipelines. Led technical engagement for a digital agency partnership to redesign a mobile app and website, structuring agreements, processes and tooling to deliver well-tested, well-documented code while keeping our internal engineering team actively engaged to ensure familiarity with the architecture and a smooth handoff. Worked closely with in-house recruiters to create a hiring plan, write job descriptions, screen candidates and craft a more inclusive interview process, doubling the size of the engineering team and laying the groundwork for continued growth.
