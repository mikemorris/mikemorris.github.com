Led an initiative to redesign, document and scale an Elixir API powering a food ordering mobile app and website. Stabilized production infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines, taught DevOps concepts and testing best practices to a growing engineering team, and guided software architecture evolution. Led technical engagement for a digital agency partnership to redesign a mobile app and website, structuring agreements, processes and tooling to deliver well-tested, well-documented code while keeping our internal engineering team actively engaged to ensure familiarity with the architecture and a smooth handoff. Worked closely with in-house recruiters to create a hiring plan, write job descriptions, screen candidates and craft a more inclusive interview process, doubling the size of the engineering team and laying the groundwork for continued growth.
