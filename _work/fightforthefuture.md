Worked with a close-knit team of digital activists on tech policy campaigns around net neutrality and surveillance. Built and maintained campaign sites, backend infrastructure and an embeddable widget. Collaborated with coalition partner engineers on a large day of action, monitoring critical infrastructure and rapidly triaging bugs to ensure stability while collecting petition signatures and delivering comments to U.S. Congressional representatives and the Federal Communications Commission.
