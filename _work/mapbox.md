Worked with a globally distributed team to build and maintain an API for rendering static map images using an open source C++/OpenGL rendering engine with Node.js bindings. Architected and built an open source tool for processing font files into an efficient format suitable for OpenGL glyph rendering. Contributed to drafting a privacy policy, law enforcement guidelines and technical architecture for collecting user data while maximizing privacy, security and anonymity.
