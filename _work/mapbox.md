Worked with a globally distributed team to build, maintain and operate an API for rendering static map images using an open source C++/OpenGL rendering engine with Node.js bindings, using the RED method for performance benchmarking and monitoring. Architected and built an open source tool for processing font files with the FreeType library into an efficient format suitable for OpenGL glyph rendering. Contributed to drafting a privacy policy, law enforcement guidelines and technical architecture for collecting user data while maximizing privacy, security and anonymity.
