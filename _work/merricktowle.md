Worked in a deadline-driven small agency environment to build and maintain CMS-powered websites for real estate development clients, using current standards and best practices and testing across multiple browsers to ensure consistency. Reviewed resumes, interviewed candidates and made hiring recommendations to successfully rebuild an in-house development team after the departure of senior developers.
